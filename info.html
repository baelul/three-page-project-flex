        <h2>Gender Gap</h2>
          <p>&emsp;Women make up only 28% of the workforce in science, technology,
            engineering and math (STEM), and men vastly outnumber women majoring
             in most STEM fields in college. The gender gaps are particularly
             high in some of the fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs of the
             future, like computer science and engineering.</p>

             <h3>Key Factors perpetuating gender STEM gaps</h3>
             <h4>Gender Stereotypes</h4>
             <p> &emsp;STEM fields are often viewed as masculine, and teachers and
               parents often underestimate girlsâ€™ math abilities start as early
                as preschool.</p>
             <h4>Male-Dominated Cultures</h4>
             <p> &emsp;Because fewer women study and work in STEM, these fields tend to
                perpetuate inflexible, exclusionary, male-dominated cultures that
                 are not supportive of or attractive to women and minorities.</p>
             <h4>Fewer Role Models</h4>
             <p> &emsp;Girls have fewer role models to inspire their interest in these
                fields, seeing limited examples of female scientists and
                engineers in books, media and popular culture. There are even
                 fewer role models of Black women in math and science.</p>
             <h4>Math Anxiety</h4>
             <p> &emsp;Teachers, who are predominantly women, often have math anxiety
               they pass onto girls, and they often grade girls harder for the
               same work, and assume girls need to work harder to achieve the
               same level as boys.</p>

        <h2>Wage Gap</h2>
          <p> &emsp;While the wage gape can be said to be a problem in any field,
            the gap is exceedingly significant in the STEM field. Men in STEM
             annual salaries are nearly $15,000 higher per year than
            women ($85,000 compared to $60,828). And Latina and Black women in
            STEM earn around $33,000 less (at an average of around $52,000 a year).</p>

      <div class="confidence">
        <h2>Confidence Gap</h2>
          <p> &emsp;Many girls lose confidence in math by third grade. Boys, on the
            other hand, are more likely to say they are strong in math by 2nd
            grade, before any performance differences are evident.</p>

          <p> &emsp;Imposter syndrome is a huge problem amongst the computer science/
            engineering field, but especially amongst women in STEM. 38% of
            women who major in computers work in computer fields, and
           only 24% of those who majored in engineering work in the engineering
           field. However, a majority of health care workers are women.
           Nearly 80% of the health care workforce are women, but only about
           21% of health executives and board members are women, and only about
           a third of doctors. And, women are more highly represented in
           lower-paying fields, such as home health workers, nurses and the
           lower-paying specialties such as pediatricians.</p>
