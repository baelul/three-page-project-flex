# three-page-project-flex
Instructions
Revise your "3-Page Issue" site with extensive use of flexbox throughout.
The design and structure of your site will determine how, and how much, you use flexbox.
Feel free to make any revisions or improvements to the project based on feedback you received, thoughts you had, or new techniques available to use by using flexbox.

In my case, I made my page about the gender disparity in STEM, specifically the gender, confidence and wage gap between men and women.
For this version, flex display was to be implemented into the CSS.
